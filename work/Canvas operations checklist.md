## Operations

In the list of operations below, check all the operations that apply. For example, if you know you will need to be able to insert a single instance of the entity at a time into the database, check **Single instance** in the **Create/insert** section.

Note that the pairs of square brackets below are rendered as checkboxes in GitHub Pages. To insert a checkmark, **replace** the single space between the square brackets in the Markdown with an "x" character (uppercase or lowercase; **do not** include the quote characters). To remove a checkmark, **replace** the "x" between the square brackets with a **single** space character. Aside from adding or removing checkmarks, do not modify the formatting or content of the remainder of this section.
